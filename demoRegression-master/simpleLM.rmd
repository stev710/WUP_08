```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  
We are going to compute regression models finding one regression model that does the best job in predicting the bear length and its correspondence to the bears neck size, age, head width and head length.

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```
the adjusted r square that is the largest and is best. The neck size 0.7476.

## Compare all models that predict LENGTH other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better. 

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADLEN,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```
The adjusted R- Squared for Head length is 0.8434.

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~HEADWTH,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```
The adjusted r-squared is 0.5321 for head width.

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~AGE,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~AGE,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

The adjsuted r squared for age is 0.5073.


```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~CHEST,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

The adjusted r squared for Chest is 0.7869.


```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~WEIGHT,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~WEIGHT,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

The adjusted r squared for weight is 0.7423.
